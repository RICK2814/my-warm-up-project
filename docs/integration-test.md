# Complete Application Flow Test

## Test Scenario: Company Registration and Profile Management

### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL database running with the required schema
- Firebase project configured
- Cloudinary account configured
- Backend server running on port 5000
- All environment variables set

### Test Flow

1. **Company Registration**
   - Navigate to the registration page
   - Fill in all required fields across all steps:
     * Step 1: Company name, email, phone, password
     * Step 2: Address, city, state, country, pincode
     * Step 3: Business details (GST, PAN, registration number, etc.)
     * Step 4: Review information and upload logo (optional)
   - Submit the registration form
   - Verify successful registration message
   - Verify JWT token is received

2. **Login**
   - Navigate to the login page
   - Enter the registered email and password
   - Verify successful login
   - Verify JWT token is stored

3. **Access Protected Routes**
   - Navigate to the profile page
   - Verify that profile information is displayed correctly
   - Verify that authentication is required for protected routes

4. **Profile Management**
   - Navigate to the settings page
   - Update company information
   - Upload new logo (optional)
   - Save changes
   - Verify that changes are reflected in the system

5. **Data Validation**
   - Attempt to register with duplicate email/phone
   - Verify that validation errors are displayed
   - Attempt to submit invalid data
   - Verify that appropriate error messages are shown

6. **File Upload**
   - Upload a logo during registration
   - Upload a logo during profile update
   - Verify that the file is uploaded to Cloudinary
   - Verify that the Cloudinary URL is stored in the database
   - Verify that the logo displays correctly in the UI

### Expected Outcomes

- The registration process should complete successfully in all steps
- Authentication should work with valid credentials
- Profile updates should be persisted to the database
- File uploads should be handled securely and stored in Cloudinary
- All UI elements should be responsive across different devices
- Error handling should be appropriate throughout the application
- Data validation should prevent invalid data from being stored

### Technical Verification

1. **Backend API**:
   - All endpoints should return correct HTTP status codes
   - JWT authentication should work properly
   - Database operations should complete without errors
   - File uploads should be validated and processed correctly

2. **Database**:
   - Companies table should have the new company record
   - All company details should be stored correctly
   - Created and updated timestamps should be accurate

3. **Firebase**:
   - User account should be created successfully
   - Authentication should work as expected

4. **Cloudinary**:
   - Files should be uploaded successfully
   - URLs should be accessible and correct

### Performance Considerations

- API response times should be under 1 second for most operations
- File uploads should complete within a reasonable time
- UI should be responsive during all operations

### Security Verification

- Passwords should be hashed and not stored in plain text
- JWT tokens should have appropriate expiration times
- File uploads should be validated for type and size
- Authentication should be required for protected routes
- SQL injection should be prevented through parameterized queries

### Testing Tools Used

- Frontend: React Testing Library with Jest
- Backend: Mocha, Chai, and Supertest
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Manual testing with Postman for API endpoints
- Browser testing for UI responsiveness

### Next Steps

1. Deploy to a staging environment
2. Perform load testing
3. Conduct security testing
4. User acceptance testing
5. Performance optimization if needed
