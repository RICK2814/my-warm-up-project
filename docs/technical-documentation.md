# Technical Implementation Details

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a standard client-server architecture with a React frontend and Node.js/Express backend. The architecture is designed with scalability and security in mind, implementing best practices for authentication, data validation, and error handling.

## Frontend Architecture

### Components Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Registration/
│   │   ├── RegistrationForm.tsx
│   │   ├── Step1.tsx
│   │   ├── Step2.tsx
│   │   ├── Step3.tsx
│   │   └── Step4.tsx
│   └── Settings/
│       ├── SettingsPage.tsx
│       └── ProfileEdit.tsx
├── pages/
├── assets/
├── css/
└── App.tsx
```

### Multi-Step Registration Flow
1. **Step 1**: Account Information (name, email, phone, password)
2. **Step 2**: Address Information (address, city, state, country, pincode)
3. **Step 3**: Business Details (GST, PAN, registration number, incorporation date, business type, etc.)
4. **Step 4**: Review and submit with optional logo upload

### State Management
The frontend uses React's useState and useEffect hooks for local component state management. For more complex state management, it could be extended with Context API or Redux.

## Backend Architecture

### Directory Structure
```
backend/
├── src/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── middleware/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── config/
├── tests/
├── database/
└── uploads/
```

### API Design
All API endpoints follow RESTful principles:
- Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Return JSON responses
- Follow consistent naming conventions

### Authentication Flow
1. **Registration**: 
   - Validate input data
   - Check for duplicate email/phone
   - Hash password
   - Create Firebase user
   - Store company in database
   - Generate JWT token

2. **Login**:
   - Validate credentials
   - Retrieve company from database
   - Generate JWT token

3. **Protected Routes**:
   - Verify JWT token
   - Attach user information to request object

### Error Handling
- Centralized error handling in controllers
- Appropriate HTTP status codes
- Meaningful error messages
- Proper logging

### Data Validation
- Input validation at API endpoints
- Database constraints
- File type and size validation for uploads

## Database Design

The PostgreSQL database is normalized to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The schema includes:

- **Companies table**: Core company information
- **Company documents table**: Document storage references
- **Verification logs table**: Track verification status
- **Company sessions table**: Track active sessions (optional)

### Indexes
- Indexes on frequently queried fields (email, phone, status)
- Foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity

## Security Measures

1. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - JWT tokens for session management
   - Middleware to protect routes
   - Secure password hashing with bcrypt

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Server-side validation of all inputs
   - Sanitization of user inputs
   - File upload validation

3. **Database Security**:
   - Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Proper access controls

4. **API Security**:
   - Rate limiting (could be implemented)
   - CORS configuration
   - Environment variables for sensitive data

## File Upload Handling

### Cloudinary Integration
- Direct upload to Cloudinary for scalability
- Automatic image optimization
- Secure file URLs
- Organized folder structure

### Process Flow
1. File uploaded to server temporarily
2. File validated for type and size
3. Uploaded to Cloudinary
4. Cloudinary URL stored in database
5. Temporary file removed from server

## Testing Approach

### Backend Tests
- API endpoints testing with Supertest
- Database operations testing
- Authentication flow testing
- Error handling verification

### Frontend Tests
- Component rendering tests
- User interaction tests
- Form validation tests
- State management verification

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database**:
   - Proper indexing for queries
   - Connection pooling
   - Optimized queries

2. **API**:
   - Efficient data fetching
   - Caching where appropriate
   - Asynchronous operations

3. **Frontend**:
   - Component optimization
   - Code splitting
   - Lazy loading

## Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables
Production environments should have proper environment variables set for:
- Database credentials
- JWT secrets
- Firebase configuration
- Cloudinary credentials
- API base URLs

### Build Process
- Frontend: Create production build with optimizations
- Backend: Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- Dependencies: Install production-only packages

## Monitoring and Logging

While not implemented in this version, production deployments should consider:
- Application logging
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Audit logs for sensitive operations

## Scaling Considerations

1. **Database**: Connection pooling, read replicas
2. **File Storage**: Cloudinary handles scaling automatically
3. **Application**: Horizontal scaling with load balancer
4. **Authentication**: Firebase handles scaling automatically

## Future Enhancements

1. Real-time notifications
2. Email/SMS verification
3. Advanced reporting and analytics
4. Role-based access control
5. API rate limiting
6. More comprehensive file validation
7. Audit trail for all operations
8. Integration with accounting software
